Autorefresh
===========

Auto update CSS styles without having to reload the page

With that simple js file, everytime you make changes to a CSS file and turn back to the page (by opening the 
browser - doing an Alt + Tab for example) the page will automatically reload the CSS files without reloading 
the entire page.

Usage
===========

Just save <b>autorefresh.js</b> to a folder of your project, then add it to your page:

&lt;script src="autorefresh.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

That is enough for it to start working. Everytime you save your CSS file and return to browser, the styles 
will be updated.

Copyright
===========

You can use Autorefresh anyway you want. You are free to update it (please send me an e-mail with your cool ideas!) 
any way you want.
