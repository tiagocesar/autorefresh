Autorefresh
===========

Auto update CSS styles without having to reload the page

With that simple js file, everytime you make changes to a CSS file and turn back to the page (by opening the 
browser - doing an Alt + Tab for example) the page will automatically reload the CSS files without reloading 
the entire page.

Usage
===========

Just save <b>autorefresh.js</b> to a folder of your project, then add it to your page:

<script src="autorefresh.js"></script>

That is enough for it to start working.
